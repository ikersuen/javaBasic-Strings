Q1. What is the knowledge point of the test? Where is the offical document to the knowledge point?
A1. The knowledge point is java basic string comparison concept and string operation (such as string.trim())

Q2. Why the test failed at first?
A2. Because the default output is not the expected test result, some are null and some are empty

Q3. Why you corrected the test that way?
A3.
Test1: the modified string is different with original string, changed context
Test2: string.trim() copy string with leading and trailing whitespace omitted
Test3: string concat to a new string
Test4~5: substring to get the desired part of string
Test6~7: split to get desired words
Test8: Just append necessary ascii char to the string
Test9: Calculate the sum of character length to get the checksum
Test10: Perform unicode with "\u"
Test11: Used StringBuilder reverse function will be more efficient to write a for loop
Test12: Just determine whether the result is true or false
Test13: Just understand the output and write the string as expected text

Q4. Do you have further questions on this knowledge point?
A4. No.
